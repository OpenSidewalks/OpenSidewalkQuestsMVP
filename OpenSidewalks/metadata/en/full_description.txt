Help improve transit and pedestrian info on OpenStreetMap!

This app finds map features in your vicinity that need more information and
displays them as quest markers. Tapping a quest marker launches a simple
survey question that, when completed, will add important and useful data on
transit and pedestrian accessibility. For example, describing the amenities at
a bus stop helps people with impaired vision identify and use transit stops.

The info you enter is then directly added to the OpenStreetMap in your name,
without the need to use another editor.
